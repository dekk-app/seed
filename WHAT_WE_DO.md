# What we do

Dekk aims to create a platform that allows the presentation of ideas in any form.  
This could be presentation in form of slides or even an experience in mixed reality.

## How does Dekk make money?

Dekk aims for crowdfunding, that means Dekk will not make money (in its beginning stages).  
We aim to create an accessible and fully free platform.  
If Dekk proves to be successful we will create different branches that create paid products. These price of these
products will compensate the production costs. Every cent above that will be donated to other NPOs.

## Is Dekk an NPO?

No, as of now Dekk is just an idea. We aim to find the best business type and model to ensure that we are forced to keep
our word.

## Tell me more about the product "Dekk"

Dekk is a platform that allows everybody to present their ideas.  
Our big goal is to create a decentralized, free and anonymous virtual/augmented/mixed reality platform. Think of it as a
meta-verse without ads, without tracking, without recommendations.  
There is no algorithm involved in delivering content to its users. You promote your content, you can host your content,
we just enable you to create it and make it available to everybody with internet access.

## Explain "Equal pay" to me

Dekk will pay each of its employees the exact same amount of money. That means, CEO, CTO, senior or junior developers,
office management and even part-time employees will all get the same salary.  
When we start creating hardware then this rule applies to every factory worker as well.  
In general "Every employee has the same salary".

## How can I help?

* You can tell others about our idea.
* Open an issue in this repository and ask questions. We are happy to answer them and get inspired.
* Join us by contacting us and help us build Dekk.

We do not want your money until we have taken actions that prevent us from dishonouring money.  
We do not take donations of any form right now.

## Can I pay in cryptocurrency?

Dekk is a free service. Since we aim to build our platform with web3 technologies, blockchains and cryptocurrency are a
very big topic to us.

## Can I create NFTs with Dekk?

Go ahead, do what you want, it's your presentation.
